An arcade game inspired a lot by Space Taxi that was released on the Commodore 64...

## To do list:

- Add next level functionality.
- [SH 2018-07-05] ~~Change fuel functionality to only allow X units of fuel.~~
- Add a Space Cop that shows up sometimes. We need to avoid him while he's on the screen.
- Add switches mechanics to open/close parts of the level. In some cases to bring a customer you would need to open certain spots.
- Add the deployment of a ramp to actually let the customer get in the cab, would need to deploy it before landing. While the ramp is deployed without a customer in the cab, the thrusters should not be used at all. That way the player can't just have the ramp deployed at all times.

## Enhancements:

- [SH 2018-07-05] ~~Make the boot logo stay visible a little longer.~~
- Review the arrows – stay with lines or move to a single graphic.  My preference is the lines.
- [SC 2018-07-05]~~Design a better ‘Goto ‘ graphic. And made it's position relative to the player~~
- [SC 2018-07-04] ~~Add detection when crashing into spikes.~~
- Add crash to bottom of screen when fuel runs out.
- Add crash when you hit an obstacle at high velocity.
- Make the physics more floaty for the left/right movement so that we really need to adjust our velocity to land.

## Bugs:

- [SH 2018-07-05] ~~Thrusters are still not showing up on the title screen~~
- [SH 2018-07-05] ~~On highscore screen when entering a name pressing down goes to letter j not Z.~~
- When going back to the Title screen, the number on the sign disappears.
