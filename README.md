## To do list:

- Add next level functionality.

## Enhancements:

- Make the boot logo stay visible a little longer.
- Review the arrows – stay with lines or move to a single graphic.  My preference is the lines.
- Design a better ‘Goto ‘ graphic.
- Add detection when crashing into spikes.
- Add crash to bottom of screen when fuel runs out.
- Add crash when you hit an obstacle at high velocity.

Bugs:

- Thrusters are still not showing up on the title screen
- On highscore screen when entering a name pressing down goes to letter j not Z.
