## To do list:

- Add next level functionality.
- Change fuel functionality to only allow X units of fuel.

## Enhancements:

- [SH 2018-07-05][s]Make the boot logo stay visible a little longer.[/s]
- Review the arrows – stay with lines or move to a single graphic.  My preference is the lines.
- Design a better ‘Goto ‘ graphic.
- [SC 2018-07-04][s]Add detection when crashing into spikes.[/s]
- Add crash to bottom of screen when fuel runs out.
- Add crash when you hit an obstacle at high velocity.

## Bugs:

- Thrusters are still not showing up on the title screen
- [SH 2018-07-05][s]On highscore screen when entering a name pressing down goes to letter j not Z.[/s]
