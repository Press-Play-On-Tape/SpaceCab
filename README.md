@Vampirics and @filmote are proud to announce Version 1.0 of Space Cab - a tribute to the classic Commodore 64 game [Space Taxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Taxi).

Collect and deliver customers to their destination as quickly as possible to make the most money!  But be careful and make sure you do not run out of fuel, land without deploying your landing gear or squash a customer.


| Button | Function |
|---|---|
|A Button | Thruster. |
|B Button | Deploy landing gear.|
|Left and Right&nbsp;&nbsp;| Steering.|

</br>


On the High Score screen, pressing and holding the up and down buttons simultaneously for a few seconds resets the high scores.

As always, thanks to @pharap for his advice, help and problem solving skills.  There is a tribute level in the game with his skull in it!
